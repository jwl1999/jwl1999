- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwl1999
- 👀 I’m interested in china northeast forest management
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Using natural forest data from northeastern China, we conduct dynamic analysis of current forests and forecast future development trends. We aim to uncover the driving mechanisms of forests from ecological, climatic, and other large-scale environmental factors, revealing the cooperation mechanisms within forests. We model the potential biological laws of forests using programming tools such as R, possibly incorporating deep learning and machine learning research. Additionally, we study and innovate in the use of remote sensing technology, exploring the integration of remote sensing with forestry
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on forest management
